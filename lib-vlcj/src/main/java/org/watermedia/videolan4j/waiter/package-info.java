 * Synchronous programming framework.
 * <p>
 * Ordinarily media player programming requires an asynchronous approach, this small framework makes it easier to use a
 * synchronous approach instead.

 * Most applications are not expected to use this synchronous approach, but there are some use-cases where it can be
 * convenient.
