# üì¶ BREAKING UPDATE 2.1.0
### IMPORTANT: THIS UPDATE IS A BREAKING UPDATE! DEPENDENT MODS WILL NOT WORK IF THEY DIDN'T RELEASE A COMPATIBILITY UPDATE
**WHY UPDATE IS SMALL?**<br>
This update is focused on fix critical problems on v2 which requires breaking changes, we didn't put much
effort on this update to entirely focus on v3 development with way many and better features.<br>
Consider get hyped, this update helps me a lot on how to enhance performance on v3 and how to do SoundPhysics (i made OpenAL works)
